# Work Tracker

A modern Next.js application for tracking employee attendance, daily and monthly performance, and personal profile management.  
Built with Next.js, MongoDB, and a clean, component-driven UI.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 2. **Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root with the following variables:

```env
# MongoDB connection string
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# MongoDB database name
MONGODB_DB=your_database_name

# JWT secret for signing tokens
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

> **Tip:** Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. Each developer should set their own values.

### 3. **Run the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üìù Notes for Developers

- All authentication and profile routes require a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header.
- The UI is built with reusable components in `src/components/ui/`.
- MongoDB is used for persistent storage; see `src/lib/dbConnect.ts` for connection logic.
- The app uses React context for global auth state (`src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`).
- All pages are client components (`"use client"`).
